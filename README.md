# extrapolator.js
Quantum Key Distribution(BB84) library made with JS. But actually, from a non-linier, non subjective point of view it is more like a big ball of wibbily wobbly, timey wimey...stuff. At least it protects you from Daleks.

This system is inspired by [Quantum Cryptography Example 2 of Qiskit](https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-tutorials/blob/master/community/awards/teach_me_qiskit_2018/quantum_cryptography_qkd/Quantum_Cryptography2.ipynb), and powered by [quantum-circuit js library](https://www.npmjs.com/package/quantum-circuit).
